This project has been used for basic ColdFusion trainings. 

Except utility tools, there is no framework usage for the base code. The goal is creating a set of code with base ColdFusion features and functions. 

Same project will be refactored with frameworks such as ColdBox etc. in the future. 


In order to contribute:

* Fork the code.
* Check the issues and let the team know which tasks/bugs that you can work.
* Modify the code on your instance.
* Send a pull request to be able to send your modification to the project.
